            The experiment aimed to examine how individuals respond to extreme

          <p>
            Some psychologists and historians have suggested that the Murray
            study may have contributed to emotional distress in Ted Kaczynski,
            particularly due to his young age, social isolation, and the
            prolonged nature of the interrogations. The experiment subjected
            participants to repeated verbal humiliation, intense scrutiny, and
            psychological pressure over several years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stress-based experiments such as this are now understood to
            potentially exacerbate underlying mental health conditions. Later in
            life, Kaczynski was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a disorder that
            often emerges in early adulthood and can be aggravated by chronic
            stress.

            <p>
              However, Kaczynski himself consistently rejected the idea that the
              study had any significant influence on his later actions or
              beliefs. In his writings and correspondence, he stated that the
              experiment did not damage him and dismissed claims that it played
              a role in his development as exaggerated or misleading.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most scholars agree that no direct causal link can be established
              between the experiment and Kaczynski’s later crimes. The study is
              instead viewed as one of many factors present during a formative
              period of his life, rather than a determining cause.

            Psychologists emphasize that there is no direct causal link between
            the experiment and Kaczynski’s later violence. The study is best
            understood as one of several stressors during a vulnerable period.
