            <h2>The Manifesto Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>
              After nearly 17 years of bombings, the FBI approved publication of
              <em>“Industrial Society and Its Future.”</em> The essay criticized
              modern technology and framed violence as a necessary response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ted Kaczynski’s brother, David, recognized the language
              immediately. His decision to contact authorities became the
              pivotal break in the case.

            <h2>Arrest in Montana</h2>
            <p>
              On April 3, 1996, FBI agents arrested Kaczynski at his remote
              cabin near Lincoln, Montana. The cabin lacked electricity or
              plumbing and symbolized his rejection of modern society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investigators recovered bomb components, a live device, and over
              40,000 handwritten pages documenting his crimes and ideology.

            <h2>Trial and Sentencing</h2>
            <p>
              Prosecutors sought the death penalty, but Kaczynski’s mental
              health became a central issue. He was diagnosed with paranoid
              schizophrenia but refused an insanity defense.
            </p>
            <p>
              He pleaded guilty to multiple counts of murder and terrorism and
              was sentenced to life in federal prison without parole.

          <div>
            <h2>Life in Prison</h2>
            <p>
              Kaczynski was held at ADX Florence, a supermax facility in
              Colorado. He spent most of his sentence in near-total isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite imprisonment, he continued writing letters and essays. His
              work is still analyzed in criminology and psychology courses.

            <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
              On June 10, 2023, Ted Kaczynski was found dead in his cell. His
              death was ruled a suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
              His case remains a powerful example of how extremism, untreated
              mental illness, and isolation can culminate in long-term violence.
